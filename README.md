# Finding-Covidence
***Created: May, 2020***

**A website created for the COVID-19 challenge hosted by the New York Academy of Sciences.**
The site was built towards the beginning of the pandemic and contained methods of testing oneself for symptoms of COVID-19 when testing was not as widely available.

Some of the symptoms considered were:
- Shortness of breath
- Loss of smell
- Loss of taste
- Lack of mental awareness

We compiled a list of potential symptoms of COVID-19 and information regarding each one for the general public to be aware of how the virus presented itself.

*Our intention was not to create a test for whether or not someone had COVID-19. We only collected simple tests to see if someone demonstrated symptoms of the virus. We were **not** medically advising, diagnosing or prognosticating anything.*
